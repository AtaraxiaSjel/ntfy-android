# ntfy Android App
This is the Android app for [ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) ([ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh)).

## Current limitations
* The app on the Play store only works with ntfy.sh, not with other hosts, due to the fact that background services in 
  Android are pretty much impossible to implement.
